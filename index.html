<p>"I don't fear failures, I fear of not trying"</p>

<p>I am an aspiring data scientist and currently working my way to a specialization in Data Science from University of Washington. 
With my previous background in programing, I am applying my python, shell, command-line, UNIX, and R programming skills to 
consolidate, clean, and transform data. I am performing exploratory data analysis on data to explore and find patterns in 
data and applying statistical and computational models to infer from data. Next step in learning is to build automated methods 
of data analysis following  predictive and descriptive methods of machine learning. I am learning Hadoop and Spark frameworks 
to analyze and derive insight from large-scale, heterogeneous data and using cloud services such as AWS for scaling and 
distributed computing. </p>

<p>I have developed enough skill sets to showcase my Big Data project portfolio. Please have a look and leave any valuable 
comments. Thank you.</p>

<b><li>Machine Learning</li></b>
 

<p>Using Boston housing price data from <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>
to perform supervised machine learning algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, PCA. I have implemented K-Nearest neighbor and
Gradient descent from scratch to understand the underlying functionality of the machine learning algorithm. Naive Bayes and PCA were implemented 
using sci-kit learn python library. Regression is a powerful tool to unearth the patterns in your data and do predictions with machine learning
algorithms. Follow the link to see the working of these machine learning algorithms on Boston housing data

<b><li>Twitter Analysis</li></b>
 

<p>In this project, I used my data analysis and programming skills in python to explore the trends in the tweets for a reality 
tv series. I collected live tweets using Twitter REST APIs by writing a twitter listener in python, which takes keywords and 
twitter handle to collect the related tweets. The next step in the analysis was data cleansing, data transformation, data 
consolidation, and finally finding various patterns in the data.</p>

<b><li>Crime Incident Analysis - Seattle</li></b>


<p>This project is performed on the data sourced from [data.seattle.gov] website. The data is related to the crime incidents
reported to Seattle police departments. I performed exploratory data analysis using R programming and found interesting patterns
in the data. I plotted different visualizations to spot crime trends or patterns in the greater Seattle area. The final
visualization shows interesting patterns in crime committed at different hours of the day. </p>
