{"name":"Sumeet Sharma","tagline":"Data Science Projects","body":"### About Me\r\nHi there, I’m Sumeet Sharma. I’m currently pursuing my Masters at the University of Washington, Seattle, specializing in Data Science. I grew up in India and completed my undergrad there. I love traveling and have traveled a lot before joining the iSchool for my master's in Information management. I have traveled many parts of India (Bangalore, Pune, Kerala, Kanyakumari, Goa, Kashmir, Mumbai, Jaipur, Delhi, Punjab, Shimla, Nanital, Uttranchal, Allahabad, Bhopal); Europe (Amsterdam, Italy, Belgium, Paris, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland); and different parts of the USA. Apart from traveling, I love running and you will find me running along side Burke-Gilman trail whenever I am in Seattle. \r\n\r\nI am an aspiring data science engineer and my focus is to learn as much as I can while I am in school. To further enhance my learning at the iSchool, I have taken up an independent study under Joshua Blumenstock to understand how we work, clean, and prepare big data before we can do the cool stuff such as predictive analytics, exploratory analysis, and visualizations. I love to meet new people and share my experiences. I believe in 'sharing is caring.'\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n1.
