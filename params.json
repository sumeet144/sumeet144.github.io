I’m currently pursuing my Masters at the University of Washington, Seattle, specializing in Data Science. I grew up in India and completed my undergrad there. I love traveling and have traveled across India (Bangalore, Pune, Kerala, Kanyakumari, Goa, Kashmir, Mumbai, Jaipur, Delhi, Punjab, Shimla, Nanital, Uttranchal, Allahabad, Bhopal), Europe (Amsterdam, Italy, Belgium, Paris, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), and different parts of the USA. Apart from traveling, I love running and you will find me running along side Burke-Gilman trail whenever I am in Seattle. \r\n\r\nI am an aspiring data science engineer and would like to share some of my projects. My focus is to learn through projects and prepare myself for future challenges. \r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n1.
